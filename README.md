# CraftConnect Modular Monolith

Welcome to **CraftConnect** â€“ a modern, modular monolith platform built with .NET 9 and C# 13! This solution connects craftspeople with customers through a comprehensive booking and product management system. The platform follows Clean Architecture principles and Domain-Driven Design patterns for scalability, maintainability, and developer happiness.

- **UserManagement.Infrastructure**: Repository implementations and infrastructure services
- **UserManagement.Presentation**: API controllers and endpoints for user operations

#### Booking Management Module
- **BookingManagement.Domain**: Booking lifecycle, line items, and business logic
- **BookingManagement.Application**: Booking CQRS operations and workflow management
- **BookingManagement.Infrastructure**: Booking data persistence and external service integrations
- **BookingManagement.Presentation**: Booking API endpoints and controllers

#### Product Inventory Management Module
- **ProductInventoryManagement.Domain**: Product entities, categories, inventory management
- **ProductInventoryManagement.Application**: Product CQRS operations, DTOs, and business logic
- **ProductInventoryManagement.Infrastructure**: Product repository implementations and data access

- **RefreshTokens**: JWT refresh token management for authentication

### Booking Entities
- **Bookings**: Booking lifecycle management with status tracking
- **BookingLineItems**: Individual service items within a booking

### Product Entities
- **Products**: Product catalog with inventory management
- **Categories**: Hierarchical product categorization system

### Value Objects (Owned Types)
- **Money**: Currency and amount handling
- **Email**: Email validation and formatting
- **PhoneNumber**: Phone number validation
- **UserAddress**: Address information for users
- **GeoLocation**: Geographic coordinates
- **Skill**: Craftsperson skills with experience levels
- **Address**: Service location addresses
- **JobDetails**: Booking job specifications
- **Image**: Product and profile image management
